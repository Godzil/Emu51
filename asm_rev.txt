ASM51 Partial Revision History

1.2i
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We now allow the dollar sign character ('$') in symbols, but not as
      the first character.  This was done to support the Systronix BASIC
      compiler.  It ouputs ASM51 source and then uses MetaLink's ASM51 to
      produce the AOM file (absolute object module).  More correctly, it
      first assembles the file generated by the BASIC compiler, and then
      inserts source line number information, relative to the original
      '.BAS' BASIC source file, into the AOM file generated by ASM51.

The following are the recognized command line options:
 
      Command line arguments may be specified in any order;
      they are case-sensitive:                               
                                                              
      <something>     (assumed) name of file to be loaded initially.
                                                                 
      -D<sym> <val>   Predefine the symbol <sym> with value <val>.
                      The net effect is exactly as if you had typed
                          <sym>  EQU  <val>
                      at the beginning of the source file.
                      NOTE:  <val> is treated as a decimal number (only).
                                                                  
      -l              Output source line number information to the
                      '.DBG' file.  This line number information is
                      relative to the original '.ASM' source file.
                      This option enables source-level debugging
                      when using MetaLink's assembler (e.g., source-
                      only display in the Source Window).
                      This option is only effective when the $DEBUG
                      control statement is specified.
 
      NOTE that when running under DOS, the forward slash, '/', may also
      be used as the argument indicator (instead of the dash, '-').

1.2j
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Source line number information is now output only while processing
      the primary source file, not included files.

1.2k
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Fixed bug where the last Text/Code record output to the '.DBG' file
      was sometimes output twice, the second time with extra bytes appended.

      Added the following MOD files (for the $MODxxx directive):

          MOD File      Processor(s)
