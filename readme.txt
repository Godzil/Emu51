EMU51 (Mariusz Kasolik) - Modifications done by TRAPIER Manoel (godzil@free.fr)
Source file (platform independed)

Emulator accepts *.bin, *.hex files.
You can also compile source file by using external compiler, emu51 is compatible with
free 8051 compiler by MetaLink Corporation (http://www.metaice.com/ASM51/Files/ASM51.zip).
Just put asm51.exe into this directory and use Shift+F9 key combination to compile and load source file (only windows :-( ).
I'm still searching multiplatform 8051 assembler compiler for emu51, because i want to add full compilation support for all supported platforms.


You can find history in the file of the same name.

 - Compilation has been tested with VisualStudio 6 using latest (4.1.9) allegro library.
 - Compilation tested too with DJGPP with GCC 3.2.1 and allegro 4.1.9
